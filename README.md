## Project
5 students from WCS full-stack web dev course teamed up for the second hackaton of the bootcamp. We were asked to make a webapp in 48 hours, using TWILIO tech.

## Keep It Clean
App that allows users to create, choose or join volunteering cleaning session around the world. 
Once a new event is created by a user, all the other users of the app will receive (if they agreed with it) a Whatsapp message powerd by TWILIO tech.
It's never been easier to help saving the planet!! Thanks to Keep it Clean and TWILIO.
